<h3>My hobbies include:</h3>
<ol>
<li> Photography
  <p>Photography is a vast subject, there are so many subjects to choose from on which to master and which one would enjoy. I love to click mostly the natural ones or the ones that gives me a perfect satisfaction of where I am in.</p>
<li> Spending time with my friends
  <p>I love hanging out with my friends because I always have a good time no matter what. Some things I like to do with them are going to the movies, shopping, going to the beach in the summer, and playing sports with them.
  </p>
<li> Listening to music
  <p>Listening to music is one of my favorite hobbies. I listen to just about every type of music there is except for country. My ipod has all my favorite music on it and I bring it everywhere I go. I don't know what I would do without my ipod.</p>
<li> Traveling
  <p>I love to travel even thought I don't do it that often. I try to travel to different places when I have the opportunity. I had the best time of my life when I traveled to Ireland and I wish I could go back every year. I love being in new places where everything is different. I really want to travel to Greece one day.</p>
